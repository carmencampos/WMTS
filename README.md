There are two purposes in creating this repository.

## Python server

Tiny Tile Server is a Python server that permits the user to display local MBTiles maps on the internet. It extracts the data from the SQLite database where is store the map information in tables containing all the tiles, UTFGrid and metadata.
Tiny Tile Server shows the tiles on a website and the UTFGrid data on top of the map. It can also be used to show the getCapabilities information from Web Tile Map Service in XML format extracted by the metadata table.
The server is a part in a website whose purpose is to show how it works and provide templates for the user who wants to employ it, so he will not need to have programming knowledge in order to use Tiny Tile Server, just to follow a simple installation tutorial.
